## Arch Linux install
See the [docs file](docs.txt]) on how to install a fresh Arch Linux system.

## QEMU
Use the QEMU scripts to emulate and experiment with a new Arch Linux system. You will need the `qemu` and `ovmf` (for UEFI boot) packages. Make sure that the path to `OVMF.fd` is set correctly in [run.sh](run.sh). Also be sure to download an Arch Linux ISO and rename it `arch.iso` before running [setup.sh](setup.sh).
